# LAP Protocol Threat Model v0.2

This document analyzes potential security threats to the LAP (Linked Attestation Protocol) and evaluates how the protocol mitigates or fails to address each threat.

## Overview

LAP provides reasonable proof of publisher-resource association through cryptographic attestations and live verification. This threat model examines attacks against the protocol's four verification goals:

1. **Resource Integrity** - Content bytes match what was attested
2. **Resource Origination** - Resource came from claimed URL via same origin
3. **Resource Freshness** - Resource attestation is still accessible
4. **Publisher Resource Association** - Publisher controls the namespace

## Threat Categories

### Content Integrity Threats

#### T1: Content Tampering

**Description**: Attacker modifies fragment content after it's been signed but before verification.

**Attack Vector**: Malicious client or intermediary alters the canonical content bytes in the `<link>` element's data URL.

**LAP Mitigation**: ✅ **MITIGATED**

-   SHA-256 hash verification in Resource Attestation detects any content modification
-   Verification fails immediately on hash mismatch
-   Canonical content bytes are cryptographically protected

**Status**: ✅ Pass - Strong cryptographic protection

#### T2: Preview Content Spoofing

**Description**: Attacker modifies the preview section (`class="la-preview"`) to misrepresent the canonical content.

**Attack Vector**: Malicious client changes preview HTML while keeping canonical content intact.

**LAP Mitigation**: ❌ **NOT MITIGATED**

-   Preview content is explicitly NOT cryptographically verified
-   Protocol relies on client conformance to replace preview with canonical content
-   Verification passes even with modified preview content

**Status**: ❌ Fail - Acknowledged weakness, client responsibility

### Publisher Authentication Threats

#### T3: Publisher Impersonation

**Description**: Attacker claims to be a different publisher by forging signatures or keys.

**Attack Vector**: Creating fake Namespace Attestations with forged signatures or stolen keys.

**LAP Mitigation**: ✅ **MITIGATED**

-   Schnorr signatures (BIP-340) provide strong cryptographic authentication
-   X-only public keys prevent key substitution attacks
-   Signature verification ensures only the private key holder can create valid attestations

**Status**: ✅ Pass - Strong cryptographic protection

#### T4: Key Compromise

**Description**: Attacker obtains publisher's private key and creates malicious attestations.

**Attack Vector**: Private key theft, weak key generation, or social engineering.

**LAP Mitigation**: ❌ **NOT MITIGATED**

-   Protocol cannot prevent private key compromise
-   No key revocation mechanism
-   Compromised keys remain valid until expiration

**Status**: ❌ Fail - Outside protocol scope, operational security issue

### Network and Origin Threats

#### T5: DNS Hijacking

**Description**: Attacker controls DNS to redirect attestation fetches to malicious servers.

**Attack Vector**: DNS poisoning or domain takeover to serve fake attestations.

**LAP Mitigation**: ❌ **NOT MITIGATED**

-   Protocol relies on DNS and HTTPS for origin verification
-   No additional protection against DNS attacks
-   Same-origin requirements provide limited protection

**Status**: ❌ Fail - Relies on external infrastructure security

#### T6: Cross-Origin Attestation Injection

**Description**: Attacker serves Resource Attestations from different origins than the resource.

**Attack Vector**: Pointing `data-la-resource-attestation-url` to attacker-controlled domain.

**LAP Mitigation**: ✅ **MITIGATED**

-   Same-origin requirement for Resource Attestation URLs
-   Verification fails if RA URL origin differs from resource URL origin
-   Prevents cross-origin attestation attacks

**Status**: ✅ Pass - Strong origin enforcement

#### T7: Man-in-the-Middle Attacks

**Description**: Attacker intercepts and modifies network traffic during attestation fetching.

**Attack Vector**: Network interception to serve fake attestations or modify responses.

**LAP Mitigation**: ❌ **NOT MITIGATED**

-   Protocol relies on HTTPS for transport security
-   No additional protection against MITM attacks
-   Assumes secure transport layer

**Status**: ❌ Fail - Relies on external transport security

### Temporal and Freshness Threats

#### T8: Replay Attacks

**Description**: Attacker reuses old valid attestations after publisher has dissociated.

**Attack Vector**: Caching and replaying expired or revoked attestations.

**LAP Mitigation**: ✅ **MITIGATED**

-   Live verification requires attestations to be accessible at time of verification
-   Expiration timestamps prevent indefinite reuse
-   Dissociation removes attestations from endpoints

**Status**: ✅ Pass - Live verification prevents replay

#### T9: Clock Manipulation

**Description**: Attacker manipulates system clocks to bypass expiration checks.

**Attack Vector**: Setting system time backwards to make expired attestations appear valid.

**LAP Mitigation**: ❌ **NOT MITIGATED**

-   Protocol relies on accurate system clocks
-   No protection against clock manipulation
-   Verification depends on local time validation

**Status**: ❌ Fail - Relies on system clock integrity

### Namespace and Authority Threats

#### T10: Namespace Confusion

**Description**: Attacker creates attestations for resources outside their controlled namespace.

**Attack Vector**: Claiming control over broader namespaces than actually controlled.

**LAP Mitigation**: ✅ **MITIGATED**

-   Namespace Attestation must be served from the claimed namespace
-   URL hierarchy validation ensures resource falls under attested namespace
-   Server control verification through live attestation serving

**Status**: ✅ Pass - Strong namespace enforcement

#### T11: Subdomain Takeover

**Description**: Attacker gains control of subdomain and creates malicious attestations.

**Attack Vector**: Taking over abandoned subdomains to serve fake attestations.

**LAP Mitigation**: ❌ **NOT MITIGATED**

-   Protocol cannot prevent subdomain takeover
-   Namespace attestations cover entire subdomain trees
-   Relies on proper domain management

**Status**: ❌ Fail - Outside protocol scope, operational security issue

### Implementation and Client Threats

#### T12: Malicious Verifier

**Description**: Compromised or malicious verification library returns false results.

**Attack Vector**: Using tampered verification code that always returns "verified: true".

**LAP Mitigation**: ❌ **NOT MITIGATED**

-   Protocol cannot prevent malicious verifier implementations
-   Relies on client choosing trustworthy verification libraries
-   No mechanism to verify verifier integrity

**Status**: ❌ Fail - Client implementation responsibility

#### T13: Verification Bypass

**Description**: Client skips verification entirely and trusts content without checking.

**Attack Vector**: Malicious or lazy client implementations that don't perform verification.

**LAP Mitigation**: ❌ **NOT MITIGATED**

-   Protocol cannot force clients to verify
-   Relies on client conformance and good practices
-   Users must trust their client implementations

**Status**: ❌ Fail - Client implementation responsibility

#### T14: XSS via Canonical Content

**Description**: Malicious canonical content contains JavaScript that executes when injected into DOM.

**Attack Vector**: Publisher includes `<script>` tags or event handlers in canonical content.

**LAP Mitigation**: ✅ **PARTIALLY MITIGATED**

-   Protocol requires clients to sanitize canonical content before DOM injection
-   Verification ensures content authenticity but not safety
-   Client must implement proper XSS prevention

**Status**: ⚠️ Partial - Requires client-side sanitization

### Cryptographic Threats

#### T15: Hash Collision Attacks

**Description**: Attacker finds SHA-256 collision to create different content with same hash.

**Attack Vector**: Creating malicious content that produces the same SHA-256 hash as legitimate content.

## Security Recommendations

### For Publishers

1. **Secure Key Management**: Use hardware security modules or secure key storage
2. **Regular Key Rotation**: Implement key rotation strategies with appropriate expiration times
3. **Domain Security**: Maintain control over domains and subdomains
4. **Monitor Attestations**: Regularly verify your attestations are being served correctly

### For Clients

1. **Verify Always**: Always perform verification before rendering content
2. **Sanitize Content**: Implement robust XSS prevention when injecting canonical content
3. **Trusted Verifiers**: Use well-audited verification libraries
4. **Secure Transport**: Always use HTTPS for attestation fetching
5. **Replace Preview**: Replace preview content with verified canonical content

### For Verifiers

1. **Fail Securely**: Implement fail-fast behavior and clear error reporting
2. **Validate Inputs**: Thoroughly validate all inputs and network responses
3. **Secure Networking**: Use secure HTTP clients with proper timeout handling
4. **Cache Safely**: Implement secure caching with appropriate TTLs

## Conclusion

LAP provides strong protection against content tampering, publisher impersonation, and replay attacks through cryptographic verification and live attestation serving. However, the protocol explicitly relies on external security mechanisms (HTTPS, DNS, system clocks) and client conformance for complete security.

The most significant limitations are:

1. **Preview content spoofing** - Acknowledged design trade-off for usability
2. **Client implementation trust** - Cannot force proper verification or sanitization
3. **Infrastructure dependencies** - Relies on DNS, HTTPS, and system clock security

These limitations are largely by design, as LAP focuses on providing reasonable proof of publisher-resource association rather than comprehensive security against all possible attacks.
