# Linked Attestation Protocol (LAP)

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **EXPERIMENTAL** - Not production ready, seeking feedback

## What is LAP?

LAP lets you verify that content actually came from its claimed publisher, even when it's shared across different websites. Think of it as a live, cryptographic link between content and creator that travels with the content.

**Example:** Alice posts something on her site ‚Üí Westley embeds it on his site ‚Üí You can verify it really came from Alice.

## Try the Demo! üöÄ

See LAP in action in under 2 minutes:

### 1. Start the servers (3 terminals)

```bash
# Terminal 1: Alice's content
go run ./apps/server/cmd/publisherapi

# Terminal 2: Verification service
go run ./apps/verifier-service/cmd/verifier-service

# Terminal 3: Demo page
go run ./apps/client-server/cmd/client-server
```

### 2. Visit the demo

-   **Alice's posts**: http://localhost:8080/people/alice/frc/posts/
-   **LAP Play page**: http://localhost:8081

### 3. What you'll see

-   Content with cryptographic proof of authenticity
-   Real-time verification across different sites
-   How publishers can associate/dissociate from content

## Requirements

-   Go 1.22+

## Building

To build all binaries for the project:

```bash
go run build.go
```

This will create all binaries in the `bin/` directory:

-   `lapctl` - CLI tools
-   `publisherapi` - Alice's content server
-   `client-server` - Demo page server
-   `verifier` - CLI verifier
-   `verifier-service` - HTTP verifier service

## Advanced Usage

<details>
<summary>CLI Tools & SDK</summary>

### lapctl CLI

```bash
# Build all binaries (recommended)
go run build.go

# Or build just lapctl
go build -o bin/lapctl ./apps/tools-cli/cmd/lapctl

# Reset demo artifacts
./bin/lapctl reset-artifacts

# Generate new keys
./bin/lapctl keygen -name myname

# See all commands
./bin/lapctl help
```

### Go SDK

```go
import "github.com/stonebraker/lap/sdks/go/pkg/lap"
```

### Detailed CLI Commands

Build all binaries (recommended):

```bash
go run build.go
```

Or build individual tools:

```bash
go build -o bin/lapctl ./apps/tools-cli/cmd/lapctl
```

Generate a secp256k1 keypair:

```bash
bin/lapctl keygen -name alice
```

Reset all LAP artifacts for Alice (complete refresh):

```bash
bin/lapctl reset-artifacts
```

-   **Purpose**: Complete reset of all LAP artifacts - creates new Namespace Attestation and updates all posts
-   **Output**: Creates new `_la_namespace.json`, `_la_resource.json` and `index.htmx` for posts 1-3, updates host file
-   **Optional**: `-base` (default: `http://localhost:8080`), `-root` (default: `apps/server/static/publisherapi/people/alice`), `-keys-dir` (default: `demo-keys`)

Create a Resource Attestation (RA) for an HTML file:

```bash
bin/lapctl ra-create \
  -in apps/server/static/publisherapi/people/alice/frc/posts/1/content.htmx \
  -url http://localhost:8080/people/alice/frc/posts/1 \
  -publisher-claim ac20898edf97b5a24c59749ec26ea7bc95cc1d2859ef6a194ceb7eeb2c709677 \
  -namespace-attestation-url http://localhost:8080/people/alice/_la_namespace.json
```

-   **Purpose**: Creates an unsigned Resource Attestation JSON that links content to its publisher
-   **Output**: Writes RA JSON to `<dir>/_la_resource.json` by default (override with `-out`)
-   **Content**: Includes SHA-256 hash of the HTML file, publisher's public key, and namespace attestation URL
-   **Required**: `-publisher-claim` (64-char hex secp256k1 X-only public key) and `-namespace-attestation-url`
-   **Optional**: `-base` for resolving relative URLs, `-out` for custom output path

Create a Namespace Attestation (NA) for a namespace:

```bash
bin/lapctl na-create \
  -namespace https://localhost:8080/people/alice/ \
  -exp 1754909400 \
  -privkey b390add8da13892d0a4ca22ef5aa5f8efd4c0331bd3c2b3ce28eade7beac0c5b \
  -out apps/server/static/publisherapi/people/alice
```

-   Writes NA JSON to `<dir>/_la_namespace.json` by default (override with `-out`)
-   Required: `-namespace` URL
-   Optional: `-exp` expiration timestamp (default: 1 year from now), `-privkey` for specific key, `-rotate` to force new keypair

Create a fragment (index.htmx) from `index.html`:

```bash
bin/lapctl fragment-create \
  -in apps/server/static/publisherapi/people/alice/frc/posts/1/content.htmx \
  -url http://localhost:8080/people/alice/frc/posts/1 \
  -publisher-claim ac20898edf97b5a24c59749ec26ea7bc95cc1d2859ef6a194ceb7eeb2c709677 \
  -resource-attestation-url http://localhost:8080/people/alice/frc/posts/1/_la_resource.json \
  -namespace-attestation-url http://localhost:8080/people/alice/_la_namespace.json
```

Show help:

```bash
bin/lapctl help
```

### Technical Details

This repository contains:

-   **publisherapi**: static file server for demonstrating LAP protocol with live examples
-   **client-server**: interactive demo server showing LAP content verification and integration
-   **verifier-cli**: CLI tool for LAP resource attestation verification with full cryptographic validation
-   **verifier-service**: HTTP service for real-time LAP fragment verification
-   **tools-cli (lapctl)**: primary CLI for LAP operations including key generation and attestation creation
-   **Go SDK**: comprehensive Go library for LAP operations (canonicalization, crypto, verification, wire format)

There are two Go modules tied together by `go.work` at the repo root:

-   Root module (servers, CLI): `module lap`
-   SDK module (libraries): `sdks/go` (module `github.com/stonebraker/lap/sdks/go`)

**LAP Protocol Status**: This is a complete implementation of the Linked Attestations Protocol (LAP) v0.2 with working cryptographic verification for **Resource Attestations** and **Namespace Attestations**, Go SDK support, and comprehensive test coverage. JavaScript library support is currently being refactored.

**The protocol is not considered production ready.** The project is currently seeking feedback on all aspects, including _any compelling evidence_ that it cannot perform the function it is meant to perform, the organization and ease of use of the docs and reference implementation, documentation improvements, etc.

### Cryptography

The implementation uses SHA-256 hashing for Resource Attestation content integrity and secp256k1 + Schnorr signatures for Namespace Attestation publisher verification, with comprehensive validation including hash validation, signature verification, and drift detection.
