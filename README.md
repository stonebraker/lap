# Linked Attestations Protocol (LAP)

## What is it?

The Linked Attestations Protocol is a lightweight, http-based protocol meant to solve the problem of enabling both association and dissociation between publisher and distributed micro-content on the web. It uses basic http + a bit of cryptography, and requires no intermediary or central coordinator.

### Basic use case

1. Alice posts a self-contained bit of micro-content to her own website and permits cross origin access to Jane.
2. Jane fetches the micro-content (an html fragment, not a full html doc), and embeds it in a page on her own website.
3. Eduardo visits Jane's site and is able to verify that the post he sees there actually came from Alice.

**What it does**  
This protocol concerns itself with linking a publisher to distributed micro-content, and allowing for the verification of that link. Conversely, it allows for the unlinking of a publisher from distributed micro-content, should the publisher choose.

**What it does not do**  
It does not concern itself with the fetching and embedding of content which can be easily implemented thanks to libraries like HTMX or Datastar and should one day be part of the HTTP spec.

## The repo

This repository contains:

-   **publisherapi**: static file server for demonstrating LAP protocol with live examples
-   **verifier-cli**: CLI tool for LAP resource attestation verification with full cryptographic validation
-   **tools-cli (lapctl)**: primary CLI for LAP operations including key generation and attestation creation

There are two Go modules tied together by `go.work` at the repo root:

-   Root module (servers, CLI): `module lap`
-   SDK module (libraries): `sdks/go` (module `github.com/stonebraker/lap/sdks/go`)

**LAP Protocol Status**: This is a partial implementation of the Linked Attestations Protocol (LAP) with working cryptographic verification for **Resource Attestations**, cross-language support (Go + JavaScript), and comprehensive test coverage. **Namespace Attestation** verification is a work in progress.

**The protocol is not considered production ready.** The project is currently seeking feedback on all aspects, including _any compelling evidence_ that it cannot perform the function it is meant to perform, the organization and ease of use of the docs and reference implementation, documentation improvements, etc.

### Requirements

-   Go 1.22+

### Build / Run

Run from the repository root so default static directories resolve correctly. You can override directories with `-dir` flags.

Create a `bin/` directory for built binaries:

```bash
mkdir -p bin
```

Build binaries:

```bash
go build -o bin/publisherapi ./apps/server/cmd/publisherapi
go build -o bin/verifier ./apps/verifier-cli/cmd/verifier
go build -o bin/lapctl ./apps/tools-cli/cmd/lapctl
```

Build all (workspace):

```bash
go build ./apps/...
```

Run the demo server (from repo root):

```bash
go run ./apps/server/cmd/publisherapi   # serves ./apps/server/static/publisherapi on :8081 by default
```

Optional: run with explicit flags

```bash
go run ./apps/server/cmd/publisherapi -addr :8081 -dir apps/server/static/publisherapi
```

Run the verifier CLI:

```bash
go run ./apps/verifier-cli/cmd/verifier -h
```

The implementation uses secp256k1 cryptography for resource attestations with comprehensive verification including hash validation, signature verification, and drift detection.

### Tools CLI: lapctl

Build the tools CLI:

```bash
go build -o bin/lapctl ./apps/tools-cli/cmd/lapctl
```

Create a Resource Attestation (RA) for an HTML file:

```bash
# absolute URL
bin/lapctl ra-create \
  -in apps/server/static/publisherapi/people/alice/posts/1/index.html \
  -url http://localhost:8081/people/alice/posts/1 \
  -kid v1

# or relative URL with -base
bin/lapctl ra-create \
  -in apps/server/static/publisherapi/people/alice/posts/1/index.html \
  -url /people/alice/posts/1 -base http://localhost:8081 \
  -kid v1
```

-   Writes RA JSON to `<dir>/_lap/resource_attestation.json` by default
-   Stores/reads per-resource keys under `keys/<input-path>/resource_key.json` (override with `-keys-dir`)
-   Freshness window: `-window-min` (default 10); optional `-ttl` seconds
-   Optional: `-etag`, `-privkey`, `-rotate`, `-out`  
    -etag: Overrides the ETag embedded in the attestation. If not set, a weak ETag is computed as W/"<sha256(body)>". Use this to match a server-provided ETag exactly.  
    -privkey: Use a specific hex-encoded secp256k1 private key for the resource. If provided, itâ€™s used for signing and stored under the -keys-dir path.  
    -rotate: Forces a new per-resource keypair even if one already exists (unless -privkey is given). The new key is stored and used to sign, changing the resource_key.

Create a fragment (index.htmx) and matching RA from `index.html`:

```bash
bin/lapctl fragment-create \
  -in apps/server/static/publisherapi/people/alice/posts/1/index.html \
  -url /people/alice/posts/1 \
  -base http://localhost:8081 \
  -window-min 10 \
  -kid key-post-1
```

Update multiple posts with different freshness windows (useful for testing):

```bash
bin/lapctl update-posts \
  -base http://localhost:8081 \
  -w1 30s \
  -w2 5m \
  -w3 10m \
  -kid-prefix key-post-
```

-   Writes fragment to `<dir>/index.htmx` and RA to `<dir>/_lap/resource_attestation.json`
-   Same key handling and timebox flags as `ra-create`

Show help:

```bash
bin/lapctl help
```
