# LAP Protocol Stability Notice

## Current Status: EXPERIMENTAL

The Linked Attestation Protocol v0.2 specification is **complete** and **open to use and feedback**, but remains **experimental**.

### What This Means

-   **Specification Complete**: v0.2 protocol specification is finalized and open to use
-   **Breaking Changes**: Unlikely for v0.2, but protocol is still experimental
-   **API Changes**: Fragment structure, verification methods, and cryptographic requirements are stable for v0.2
-   **Implementation Risk**: Reference implementation conforms to v0.2 specification
-   **Production Use**: **Strongly discouraged** - this is experimental software

### Development Phases

1. **Current: Community Feedback & Implementation** üìù

    - v0.2 specification complete and open to use
    - Reference implementation conforms to v0.2
    - Seeking community feedback and testing
    - No breaking changes expected for v0.2

2. **Next: Stabilization & Production Readiness** üöß

    - Address community feedback
    - Performance and security audits
    - Production readiness assessment
    - v0.2.0 stable release preparation

3. **Future: Stable Release** ‚úÖ
    - v0.2.0 stable release
    - Semantic versioning begins
    - Production readiness

### For Developers

-   **Using v0.2**: Feel free to implement and test the v0.2 specification
-   **Building**: v0.2 APIs are stable and unlikely to change
-   **Production**: Wait for v0.2.0 stable release
-   **Feedback**: Contributions and feedback welcome

### Stability Commitment

For v0.2 specification:

-   **No breaking changes** expected
-   **API stability** maintained
-   **Bug fixes** and **improvements** may be made
-   **Security updates** as needed

Once v0.2.0 is released:

-   Semantic versioning will be followed
-   Breaking changes only in major versions
-   Deprecation notices for API changes
-   Migration guides for version updates
