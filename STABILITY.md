# LAP Protocol Stability Notice

## Current Status: UNSTABLE

The Linked Attestation Protocol is currently in **active development** with **no stability guarantees**.

### What This Means

-   **Breaking Changes**: Expected frequently without advance notice
-   **API Changes**: Fragment structure, verification methods, and cryptographic requirements may change
-   **Implementation Risk**: Reference implementations will be updated to match specification changes
-   **Production Use**: **Strongly discouraged** until v0.2.0 stable release

### Development Phases

1. **Current: Specification Development** üöß

    - Protocol design and documentation
    - Breaking changes expected
    - No implementation stability

2. **Next: Reference Implementation Updates** üìù

    - Update existing libraries and examples
    - API stabilization begins
    - Beta testing phase

3. **Future: Stable Release** ‚úÖ
    - v0.2.0 stable release
    - Semantic versioning begins
    - Production readiness

### For Developers

-   **Experimenting**: Feel free to explore the v0.2 specification
-   **Building**: Expect to rebuild as the protocol evolves
-   **Production**: Wait for v0.2.0 stable release

### Stability Commitment

Once v0.2.0 is released:

-   Semantic versioning will be followed
-   Breaking changes only in major versions
-   Deprecation notices for API changes
-   Migration guides for version updates
